### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mithrandir
- Iâ€™m currently learning both embedded systems development (in C and hopefully Rust soon) and web development in Rust.
- I am working on visually tracking a group of drones using IR cameras and using the spatial data to execute planned trajectories.
- Aside from this, I am working on porting Doom (the original) to STM32-L47 with a 3x4 pixel LED matrix as the world's most unplayable game.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Weierstrass factorisation is great:
$\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i} = \sum \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} = x \prod (1-\frac{4x^2}{n^2\pi^2})$
